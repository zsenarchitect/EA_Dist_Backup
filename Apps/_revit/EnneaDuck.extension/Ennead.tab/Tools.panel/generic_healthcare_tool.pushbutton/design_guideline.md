# NYU Health Design Guidelines


## Setup Requirements

- Base of design must have PIM #

### Required Area Schemes
- **"GFA Scheme"** [Area Scheme] 
  - Tracing of outline on each level
  - Single area per level

- **"DGSF Scheme"** [Room Based]
  - SD stage: Room separation lines
  - DD stage: Walls as bounding elements

### Required Parameter Lists
- Area parameters
- Room parameters
- Parking parameters

### Essential Families
- Elevator
- Elevator door
- Parking stall
- Patient bed room planner

## Area Tracking Workflow

### Concept and SD Phase
- Use rooms for area calculations
- Use room separation lines as bounding elements
- **Important Note on Design Options:** 
  - Avoid using design options for total massing studies (e.g., T building vs L building)
  - Instead, duplicate the entire model for new schemes
  - Risk warning: Design options can be tricky!

### DD Phase and Later
- Switch to walls as bounding elements
