"""
The main purpose of this module is to add the "public lib" directory to the system path,
allowing us to import Ennead Core modules from that directory.
This import should be added at the top of all extension scripts/modules.

This is only nessary for _revit extension scripts becasue pyRevit has a special lookup
logic that need to follow. Other _app do not need this pather


Why called "proDUCKtion"?
Wrong question, next

Why it is in a "KingDuck.lib" folder? 
No reason. Just a convention. The part matters is the .lib extension
and its location next to the .extension folder.
