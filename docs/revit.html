this script allows listing of both 2d detail items and 3d families in dedicated views.
detail items are placed in a drafting view while 3d families can be placed in either
a 3d view or floor plan view. families are organized by category with labels and optional tags.

key features:
- supports both 2d detail items and 3d families
- organizes families by category with clear labeling
- creates dedicated views for family display
- optional tagging support
- handles hosted families with appropriate host elements
- creates category-specific filtered views

note: 
3d families will be visible in all project views. the script creates an internal level 
far from the main project levels to minimize interference.

this script processes block data exported from rhino to create or update corresponding families in revit.
key features:
- creates new families from rhino block geometry
- updates existing family instances
- handles transformations (move/rotate) by removing old instances and creating new ones
- preserves block parameters as family parameters
- supports both uv projection (flat-modeled) and standing geometry
- maintains rhino block ids for tracking

input: .internal data files containing block data from rhino
output: revit family instances with matching geometry and parameters
